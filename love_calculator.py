# This is a love calculator program. It takes the names of two people from the User
# It checks the number of times the letters in the word "TRUE" (i.e. "T", "R", "U", "E") is found in both names
# It also found the number of times the letters in the word "LOVE" (i.e. "L", "O", "V", "E") is found in both names
# It then combines these numbers to make a 2-digit number e.g. if the letters in TRUE occurs 3 times and the letters
# in "LOVE" occurs 5 times, it combines the numbers to give "35".
